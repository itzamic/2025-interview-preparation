- Race Condition: A software bug that occurs when the outcome of a program depends on the unpredictable timing or sequence of events, such as multiple processes or threads accessing and modifying the same shared data. The most common type of race condition is `check-then-act`, where a potentially stale observation is used to make a decision on what to do next.
